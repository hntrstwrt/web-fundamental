<h1>The Friday the 13th I'll Always Remember</h1>
<p>It was the end of spring semester and I was all packed up and ready to fly back to my hometown on the west coast; all that was left was getting to the airport and boarding the plane. My flight boarded at 6:30pm out of Newark Airport, so I decided to leave my dorm in the East Village at 3:00pm. Usually, I'd only give myself about an hour and a half of slack time, but I thought this time I'd be extra prepared. I got in my Uber at 3:00pm and briefly, <i>everything felt fine.</i></p>
<p><b>But here's the thing:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I woke up feeling like something was about to happen, I wasn't sure what...but I could feel it.</li>
<li>Every time I have to fly I already feel like something terrible is about to happen.</li>
<li>I had like 300 pounds of luggage with me so there was no way I was about to take the train.</li>
<li> Uber, which I already know is a scam, really took advantage on that day.</li>
<li>Traffic, of all days, decided that day was the day it was going to have me really messed up.</li>
