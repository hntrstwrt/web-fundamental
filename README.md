To understand what goes on when one accesses the Internet and visits a webpage, one first needs to understand the difference between the Internet and a web page — which is a distinction I learned about 10 minutes ago when I read Chris Woodford’s “How the World Wide Web (WWW) works.”

In his article, Woodford defines the Internet as the global network that exists between all computer devices. The Internet is the relationship between computers worldwide. When I communicate to my professor via Canvas, I am using a web page, which accesses the Internet, to connect me to my professor’s device so that they can read and reply to my message. 

A webpage, as defined by Woodford and to the best of my understanding, is an application that works with the Internet to deliver a desired task/service for the user. For instance, Gmail is an application (webpage) that uses the Internet to receive and send messages. 

But there’s still more to it than that — and probably much more than I still only partially understand. Because the communication that happens between computers is more complex than I made it sound above. There are different languages, two of which I was just made aware of. There’s HTTP and HTML, which have similar but still different uses. 

HTTP is the language used between a web browser and a web server to display the customer’s desired information. When I log onto a music website and wish to download a song, the web browser that I am on will ask the site’s server (where the site information is hosted) for my desired download using HTTP. 

Meanwhile, HTML is the language used to design all web pages. HTML is a set of indicators that web browsers read in order to properly display the page attached to the URL a user searched.

In short, when I type in gmail.com (The URL for Google mail) to my web brower, I am using the Internet so that my computer can commuincate (using HTTP) with Google’s email server so that my computer can bring me to the gmail front page (which is written in HTML.) If any of these keywords mentioned were off, for instance I miswrote the URL, the HTTP or HTML had an error, I would not be able to properly view and/or use the Gmail site.
